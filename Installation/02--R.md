# Setting up conda, conda environments and programs

## Using shared R packages

To use shared R packages, users need to run the code below before running their R code:
```bash
module load gcc/12.3 r/4.4.0
export R_LIBS=/project/def-bourret/shared/R/$EBVERSIONR/

```

## Installing R packages that can be shared across members of the group

Run the code below to install shared R packages. Take note that packages are specific to a given gcc and R version, so each user needs to use the same version to be able to use these shared R packages. Also they will need to export the R library before loading the package in R (see above).

For gcc 12.3 and R 4.4.0:
```bash
module load gcc/12.3 r/4.4.0

export R_LIBS=/project/def-bourret/shared/R/$EBVERSIONR/

mkdir -p $R_LIBS

R -e 'install.packages("ade4", repos="https://cloud.r-project.org/")'
R -e 'install.packages("adegenet", repos="https://cloud.r-project.org/")'
R -e 'install.packages("ape", repos="https://cloud.r-project.org/")'
R -e 'install.packages("factoextra", repos="https://cloud.r-project.org/")'
R -e 'install.packages("seqinr", repos="https://cloud.r-project.org/")'

```
